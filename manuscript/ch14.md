# Chapter 14: Server-side rendering

## Separating client dependencies from server dependencies

In the next section you'll be adding server-side code living in the same codebase as Hyperapp client-side code.

So far you've been using Snowpack to inspect all production code for imports and translating appropriate ```node_modules``` to ```web_modules```.
It leads to 2 problems:
* you install the same dependency twice: in the ```node_modules``` and in the ```web_modules```.
* you have to exclude server code from the translation

Snowpack comes with a feature called [webDependencies](https://www.snowpack.dev/#webdependencies).

Change your **package.json**:
```
{
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "snowpack": "snowpack install --exclude '**/*' --dest=src/web_modules",
    "postinstall": "npm run snowpack",
    "format": "prettier --write '**/!(web_modules)/*.js'",
    "test": "mocha test/*Test.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "hyperapp-render": "3.2.0"
  },
  "webDependencies": {
    "@hyperapp/events": "0.0.4",
    "htm": "3.0.4",
    "hyperapp": "2.0.4",
    "hyperapp-fx": "2.0.0-beta.1",
    "page": "1.11.6"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "mocha": "7.1.2",
    "prettier": "2.0.5",
    "snowpack": "2.0.0-beta.20"
  }
}
```
After this split:
* server-side dependencies come from ```dependencies```. I already added a ```hyperapp-render``` dependency you'll be using in the next section. 
* client-side dependencies come from ```webDependencies```. I moved all previous dependencies here.

Also, we exclude all code from import analysis (```--exclude '**/*'```). In our new workflow all client-side dependencies have to be listed explicitly in ```webDependencies```.

Test the install:
```npm i```

## Rendering view and state into a string

So far you've been using Hyperapp to serialize Virtual DOM nodes into DOM nodes. 

However, you can also translate Hyperapp Virtual DOM to HTML string with a help of a library called [hyperapp-render](https://github.com/kriasoft/hyperapp-render).

Create **Server.js** in a root directory of your project (one level above **src**):
```js
import render from "hyperapp-render";
import { state, view } from "./src/Posts.js";

const html = render.renderToString(view(state));

console.log(html);
```
Make sure your **src/Posts.js** exports main view function and the initial state. 
```hyperapp-render``` should serialize your view and state into HTML string.

Run it in Node.js:
```node Server.js```

## Rendering view and state from HTTP server

You've just seen how to turn your Hyperapp views and state into HTML. You can serve this HTML from any HTTP server.

Install a popular and minimal Node.js Web application server framework [express](https://expressjs.com/):
```
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "4.17.1"
  },
```
```npm i```

Expose your Hyperapp posts as a resource with HTML representation:
```js
import render from "hyperapp-render";
import express from "express";
import { state, view } from "./src/Posts.js";

const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  const html = render.renderToString(view(state));
  res.send(html);
});
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Listening on 3000");
});
```

Run it:
```
node Server.js
```

Open ```http://localhost:3000```.

It should return unstyled HTML with a form and empty list of posts.

## Fetching data on the server

In this section you'll add a list of posts to your HTML representation. 

Server and client code have different data fetching patterns.
Client-side code usually fetches data in the background. 
For example, ```LoadLatestPosts``` effect starts when you open a browser and data is fetched in the background. 
When the data arrives Hyperapp re-renders a view with a newly fetched response data.

Server-side code has to wait for the data first and only then render the response. So this "wait before render" behavior is a major difference. 

In this book you won't be trying to create universal data fetching effects that can be shared between a client and a server. 
Instead we'll use ```axios``` and handle data in a server specific way.
```
  "dependencies": {
    "axios": "0.19.2",
    "express": "4.17.1",
    "hyperapp-render": "3.2.0"
  },
```
```npm i```

```js
import render from "hyperapp-render";
import express from "express";
import {state, view, SetPosts} from "./src/app.js";
import axios from "axios";

const app = express();

app.get("/", async (req, res) => {
    const response = await axios.get("https://hyperapp-api.herokuapp.com/api/post");
    const posts = response.data;
    const stateWithPosts = SetPosts(state, posts);
    const html = render.renderToString(view(stateWithPosts));
    res.send(html);
});
app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log("Listening on 3000");
});
```
Make sure ```SetPosts``` action is exported and use it in your server-side code. 

Open your app in the browser. A list of posts should be rendered.

To re-iterate what you've just learner: Hyperapp can be used as **a server-side template engine** with a help of ```hyperapp-render```.

## Hydrating server side code on the client side

**Hydration** is a fancy name for taking control over server-side rendered content on the client side. 
For large applications server-side rendering with or without hydration always improves the time to visible content. 
However when it comes to time to interactivity hydration always performs worse than server-side rendering or client side-rendering alone. 
In other words with hydration you pay the rendering tax twice (HTML rendering and JS rendering/hydrating). 
Since Hyperapp is really small you may not even notice the hydration penalty.

Move **src/index.html** content into **Server.js** and put it into a template string:
```js
const htmlTemplate = (content) => /* HTML */ `
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8" />
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
      <title>HyperPosts</title>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://andybrewer.github.io/mvp/mvp.css" />
      <script type="module" src="Start.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <main>
        <div id="app">${content}</div>
      </main>
    </body>
  </html>
`;
```
You'll be replacing ```content``` placeholder with dynamically rendered content.
Note: ```/* HTML */``` comment is for prettier to auto-format the string as HTML.

Update **Server.js**:  
```js
app.get("/", async (req, res) => {
  const response = await axios.get(
    "https://hyperapp-api.herokuapp.com/api/post"
  );
  const posts = response.data;
  const stateWithPosts = SetPosts(state, posts);
  const content = render.renderToString(layout(view)(stateWithPosts));
  res.send(htmlTemplate(content));
});
app.use(express.static("src"));
```
Wrap your ```view``` into a ```layout```.
Pass a server generated content into your HTML template.
Serve static files from the **src** directory. 
Put the static handler after GET "/" handler so ```src/index.html``` has lower precedence than our root resource.

Run it:
```
node Server.js
```

Test your posts page with JS enabled and disabled.

## Exercise: server side-rendering and hydration 

Implement server-side rendering and hydration for the login page. Test your app with JS enabled and disabled.

<details>
    <summary id="ssr_and_hydration">Solution</summary>

```js
import { state as loginState, view as loginView } from "./src/Login.js";

app.get("/login", async (req, res) => {
  const content = render.renderToString(layout(loginView)(loginState));

  res.send(htmlTemplate(content));
});
```

You can expand on this exercise. Some ideas for further experiments:
* serialize state and pass it from server to client to avoid double fetching initial list of posts
* build shared routing abstraction for the client and the server
