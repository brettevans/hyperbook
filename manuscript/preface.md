# Hyperapp: functional programming in your browser with 500 lines of code
# Preface

This book gives you full coverage of Hyperapp - a tiny framework for building web interfaces.

## How to use it

To benefit the most, read sections in order. I will explain every single concept with code, images and words. 
Later sections will build upon the previous ones, so don't skip anything.
The book was designed to be a hands-on tutorial so have your code editor
open all the time and code along with me. It's gonna be fun!

## How long does it take

You will need about 4 hours because this book is 7 times longer than Hyperapp [source code](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/hyperapp/blob/master/src/index.js).

## Prerequisites

* HTML, CSS, JS
* Basics of Functional Programming in JS:
    * pure functions and programming without side effects
    * higher-order functions
    * currying
    * immutability
* Some familiarity with browser DevTools (HTML elements tab, network tab, performance tab)  will be beneficial   
* Some familiarity with other JS frameworks will be beneficial    

No prior experience with Hyperapp is needed.
