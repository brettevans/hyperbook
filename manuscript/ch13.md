# Chapter 13: Client-side routing and 3rd party integration

## Preparing for client side routing

Server-side routing is easier than client-side routing. 
You let the browser handle links, forms, history, back and forward buttons. 
However in certain scenarios you need to take over the browser's job and handle routing in JS (e.g. in offline apps). 
It results in the increased complexity of your application state and subscriptions.
With client-side routing you need to track a current page and react to navigation events.
 
First, expose init action for each of your pages:

**src/Posts.js**
```javascript
export const InitPage = (_, params) => [
  { location: params.location, ...state },
  [LoadLatestPosts, ReadUsername],
];
```
You expose a way for the router to inject the current location into the current page state. 
```InitPage``` action:
* ignores state from the previous page (```_```)
* sets initial state for the posts page (```state```) 
* fires all init effects for the posts page

Do the same thing in **src/Login.js**:
```javascript
export const InitPage = (_, { location }) => ({ location, ...state });
```
There's not effects to trigger on this page. 
Make sure to remove the ```app()``` call. You'll moving towards one centralized app setup in the next section.

Finally export the ```view``` from **Login.js**:
```javascript
export const view = (state) => html`
    ...
`;
```

## Setting up the main app

Setup you Single-Page Application in **App.js**:
```javascript
import { app } from "./web_modules/hyperapp.js";
import {
  view as postsView,
  subscriptions,
} from "./Posts.js";
import { view as loginView } from "./Login.js";
import { layout } from "./Layout.js";

const pages = {
  "/": postsView,
  "/login": loginView,
};
const view = (state) => {
  const page = pages[state.location];
  return page ? page(state) : "Loading...";
};

export const start = () =>
  app({
    init: {},
    view: layout(view),
    subscriptions,
    node: document.getElementById("app"),
  });
```
You start with mapping each path to a corresponding page.
The main view function selects a page based on ```state.location``` that you'll set in the next section.
The ```init``` is an empty object for now. You'll invoke page init actions from the router.

## Integrating with 3rd party libraries

In this section you'll integrate your code with a client-side router [page.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/page.js/). 
Hyperapp may get it's own dedicated client side router in future, but the section is still relevant.
I use it to show how Hyperapp can work with any library outside of its ecosystem. 

Add ```page.js``` to ```package.json```:
```json
  "dependencies": {
    "htm": "3.0.4",
    "hyperapp": "2.0.4",
    "hyperapp-fx": "2.0.0-beta.1",
    "page": "1.11.6"
  },
```

Looking at ```page.js``` documentation I came up with the following API calls:
```javascript
import page from "./web_modules/page.js";

page("/", fn); // register a route and call fn when a user navigates to the url
page("/login", fn);

page.start(); // start client-side routing
page.stop(); // stop client-side routing
```

Install ```page.js``` and let ```snowpack``` adjust it to the browser environment:
```npm i```

When wrapping 3rd party libraries you normally put them inside subscriptions or effects.

Create **src/Router.js** with a subscription wrapping ```page.js```:
```javascript
import page from "./web_modules/page.js";

const routeSubscription = (dispatch, data) => {
    page("/", () => {

    });
    page("/login", () => {

    });

    page.start();

    return () => {
        page.stop();
    };
};
```
Start the router when the subscription is created. Stop the router when subscription is unsubscribed from.

## Mapping 3rd party calls to Hyperapp actions

Fill in the page URL change handlers with dispatch calls.
```javascript
import page from "./web_modules/page.js";
import { InitPage as InitLoginPage } from "./Login.js";
import { InitPage as InitPostsPage } from "./Posts.js";

const SetLocation = (state, location) => ({ location });

const routeSubscription = (dispatch, data) => {
  page("/", () => {
    dispatch(SetLocation, "/");
    dispatch(InitPostsPage);
  });
  page("/login", () => {
    dispatch(SetLocation, "/login");
    dispatch(InitLoginPage);
  });

  page.start();

  return () => {
    page.stop();
  };
};
```
When a user navigates to a URL store the location. It can be used for page view selection. 
Our router has a private action ```SetLocation```. 
Next, you need to initialise a current page. 
This code depends on application specific actions and can be more generic. That's what you'll do in the next section.

## Driving router design from the outside

Start from **App.js** where you'll use the router.
```javascript
import { app } from "./web_modules/hyperapp.js";
import {
  InitPage as InitPosts,
  view as postsView,
  subscriptions,
} from "./Posts.js";
import { InitPage as InitLogin, view as loginView } from "./Login.js";
import { layout } from "./Layout.js";
import { RouteListen } from "./Router.js";

const pages = {
  "/": postsView,
  "/login": loginView,
};
const pageInitActions = {
  "/": InitPosts,
  "/login": InitLogin,
};
const view = (state) => {
  const page = pages[state.location];
  return page ? page(state) : "Loading...";
};

export const start = () =>
  app({
    init: {},
    view: layout(view),
    subscriptions: (state) => [subscriptions(state), RouteListen(pageInitActions)],
    node: document.getElementById("app"),
  });
```
Our hypothetical ```RouteListen``` subscription should be configured with ```pageInitActions``` to invoke on page transitions.

From the previous usage we can create the following **Router.js** implementation:
```javascript
import page from "./web_modules/page.js";

const routeSubscription = (dispatch, data) => {
  Object.entries(data).map(([location, init]) => {
    page(location, (context) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        dispatch(init, { location, ...context.params });
      });
    });
  });

  page.start();

  return () => {
    page.stop();
  };
};

export const RouteListen = (data) => [routeSubscription, data];

```
```RouteListen``` is parametrized with data so you don't need to hardcode concrete page init actions anymore. 
In the subscription definition iterate over the config object and register a handler for each of the pages. 
Surprisingly, you need to wrap a dispatch call in ```setTimeout```. 
Current Hyperapp implementation expects asynchronous calls to dispatch, otherwise it goes into the infinite loop. 
This behavior may change in future versions. 

Test the navigation between the two pages. All anchor tags should be handled client-side. 
```page.js``` hijacks browser links so you don't need to create custom link element. 
However, when you submit your login a full page reload happens. 
```page.js``` doesn't handle forms, only links.
Therefore, you need to create a custom action for the form submission. You'll do this next.

## Wrapping 3rd party library into effects

You can wrap 3rd party libraries not only into subscriptions, but also into one-off effects and effectful actions.

Add the ```Navigate``` action to **Router.js**:
```javascript
const navigateEffect = (location) => [
  (_, location) => {
    page(location);
  },
  location,
];
export const Navigate = (location) => (state) => [
  state,
  navigateEffect(location),
];
```
```page(location)``` navigates to a given URL. 

Use the action in **Login.js**:
```javascript
import {Navigate} from "./router.js";

export const view = (state) => html`
  <form method="get" action="/" onsubmit=${Navigate("/")}>
    ...
  </form>
`;
```

If you test the code it still wouldn't work. A default browser submit still fires. In the next section you'll prevent it.

## Preventing browser events

Add a little helper library ```@hyperapp/events```:
```
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "@hyperapp/events": "0.0.4"
  },
```

Use it in **Login.js**
```javascript
import {preventDefault} from "./web_modules/@hyperapp/events.js";

export const view = (state) => html`
  <form method="get" action="/" onsubmit=${preventDefault(Navigate("/"))}>
    ...
  </form>
`;
```
```preventDefault``` decorates any event based action. The wrapping action calls ```event.preventDefault()``` 
and delegates everything else to the original action.

Install your new dependency:
```npm i``` 

Now your client-side navigation should work.
