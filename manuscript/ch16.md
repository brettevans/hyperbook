# Chapter 16: Less is more

## Dissecting elevator pitch

You started this book with the elevator pitch:
```
For JS developers. 
Who need to build highly interactive Web interfaces  
Hyperapp is a functional view and state management framework
That allows for writing easy to understand, performant and testable code
Unlike other JS frameworks
Hyperapp fits in one 434 LOC file with zero dependencies and facilitates programming in a tiny subset of JS "the very best parts"
```
To summarize everything you've learned I'd like to expand on the elevator pitch and provide more details.
For me personally Hyperapp has 3 main benefits:
* teachability
* performance
* correctness

### Teacheability

* Tiny size: with some effort I can understand Hyperapp source code without being a core contributor. 
On the other hand, most other frameworks have tens/hundreds of thousands lines of code. I am at the mercy of their documentation and people
finding time to solve my problems. With Hyperapp I just look at the code.
* Tiny API surface area: only 5 core concepts to learn. State, views, actions, effects and subscriptions. The last 4 are just functions.  
* Small subset of JS: pure functions and object literals powered by the Elm-inspired functional architecture. 
No need for this, new, classes. No need to extend from framework components or annotate code with @Component annotations.
Those things are like dandruff for your application code. 
Also, no need for hooks and special linting rules. No need for nonstandard language extensions.
* ESM native: you can use Hyperapp directly in your browser without any extra tooling in development.
* Transferable skills: Hyperapp uses core DOM Events API. The onlick, oninput, event.target.value you learned 10 years ago are still relevant.

### Performance

* Fast load time: with one file and zero dependencies Hyperapp loads fast by default (less than 2 kB). It doesn't require sophisticated performance tricks to load faster.
* No compromise in runtime performance: https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/current.html 

### Correctness

* Easy to unit test: everything is a pure function. Pass the input, verify the output. 
* Side effects at the edges: framework executes side effects, your own code is only pure functions.
* Centralized immutable state: easy to track state transitions from the old state to the new state. 

## Comparison to other technologies

You may be wondering how Hyperapp compares to other frontend solutions. Below you'll find my subjective comparison.

My choice of technology is filtered through those principles:
* Understand things from principles. 
* Understand one layer of abstraction below your normal abstraction.
* Compose solutions from simple tools solving narrow problems aka Unix Philosophy.
* Prioritize tools that give you fast feedback (fast build, fast subsecond tests etc.).  

If your principles are different probably you'd make different choices.

### Elm

Type-Driven Development in Elm makes for a very nice and beginner friendly development experience. 
Compiler taking care of runtime exceptions is very helpful.
Refactoring is much easier than in the JS/TS world. The tradeoff is that Elm requires build tools in development. You can't use a browser as your REPL.
Also some APIs that haven't been ported to Elm are harder to work with than in JS. Finally, due to limited support for generics and lack
of higher-kinded types some duplication is necessary. For some people it's a bug, for some others it's a feature.

### React

Because of the code size, I can't understand it at the source code level. It has many parts I don't care about (classes, lifecycle method etc.).

### Preact

Smaller than React. Can read the sources and understand them. Has many parts I don't care about. To emulate functional architecture requires extra libraries.

### Angular

Totally opposite approach to Hyperapp. Layers upon layers of abstraction. Too far away from the browser to my taste. Too OO centric 
and too much magical. Way too big to understand at the source code level. 

### Vue

Uses language features I tend to avoid (new, classes, this). Too big to understand at the source code level. 

### Svelte

Nice idea with code shrinking at runtime. But it's not really JS, but a compiler from JS superset. If I have to pay the price
of another language with compiler enabling dead code elimination I'd go for Elm.
