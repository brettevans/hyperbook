## Contributor checklist

* use active voice as it's usually easier to understand
* delete "There is", "There are", "Please note", "Let's"
* refer to your audience as "you" rather than "we"
* replace "to be", "happen", "occurs" with a more interesting verb if possible
* minimize usage of adjectives in tech writing
* write short sentences and eliminate unneeded words
* use the following transitional words between sentences: however, therefore, for example
* write opening sentence for each section and explain the what, why and how in each section
* introduce images, tables and code listings
* use the first items on the list to establish a pattern. E.g. start all items with a verb
* avoid jargon: explain ideas with simple words
* prefer task-based section headings: implementing, learning, testing, deploying etc.
* reveal information progressively in small chunks
* put UI elements and file names in **bold**, ```code``` and ```library names``` in triple quotes
